            <div id="snackshop-summary">My classmates and I are often working late nights and need snacks to keep us going. The problem is that most dining halls close after 8 PM and we are forced to either buy overpriced snacks through our campus cafe, delivery services, or vending machines or go hungry while trying to study. I personally could not afford to pay the high prices for snacks so I started brainstorming ideas.

        <h id="plinks">The Idea</h>
        <div class="project1">
            <div id= "dissuo-summary"> SnackShop became that idea! We planned on buying snacks wholesale from Costco to reduce our cost of the product as much as possible. Then we would package the snack into affordable boxes to be sold to students. We would then hire students in each building to store and deliver our boxes when an order came through. The student would deliver the box directly to the customerâ€™s door making it super convenient. </div>

            <div id="snackshop-summary">We knew we would be competing with the campus cafe, delivery services, and vending machines to provide late-night snacks. Our business model was constructed to provide value to the customer. We are cheaper and more convenient than all of our competition, so we were confident in our idea.

        <div class="project1">
            <div id= "dissuo-summary"> We ran the numbers and found that this business was profitable. The cost of the actual snacks and packaging totaled $2.42. We would be paying the student deliverers $1 for each delivery. That meant that we would be profiting $1.58 per box that we sold. We also did market research to find out what students would pay for our box of snacks. We found that on average, college students would be willing to pay over $9 for our product. </div>

            <div id="snackshop-summary">With the numbers crunched and the market demand validated, we decide to launch our product. We started in two buildings and advertised all over to get the word out about SnackShop. We had one person working as student deliverers in each building. We took customer orders through Venmo and delivered right to their door.  We made over 300$ in profit in the first month!

        <div class="project1">
            <div id= "dissuo-summary"> We plan on expanding our product to include boxes of laundry, school, and get well soon supplies. We believe this will allow us to capture more market demand and increase profits. We also plan to move into every building on campus as well as hiring more student deliverers in each building. Eventually, we want SnackShop to be on every college campus in America.</div>
