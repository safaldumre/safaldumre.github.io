<div class="about-me-intro">
    
    Hello, My name is Safal Dumre and I am currently a Junior at Northwestern University and an aspiring Product Manager. 
    I am in the BS/MS program pursuing my BS in Industrial Engineering and MS in Computer Science. 
    I am also taking the core MBA classes at The Kellogg School of Management and will graduate with a certificate in Managerial Analytics. 
    Often when I tell people my educational background they ask "why so many different things?" 
    <br>
    <br>
    The short answer is "it just sorta happened this way". 
    The long answer is my educational background is the result of me pursuing my passions rather than pursuing a plan. 
    That pursuit of happiness has led me to the intersection of buisness, technology, and creating great products.
    <br>
    <br>
    My Managerial Analytics certificate has allowed me to pursue traditional buisness experiences like an international buisness development internship with the first organic seed company in Costa Rica. 
    I also had the opportunity to work as a student corporate consultant for Deloitte, helping a large Non-Proft in Chicago build a data-driven model to guide their corporate partnerships. 
    <br>
    <br>
    My computer science degree has allowed me to take on exciting technical experiences researching machine learning applications in data imputation and a software engineering project where I led a team of engineers to create a recommendation algorithm for a local startup. 
    <br>
    <br>
    As much as I love analyzing buisness problems and solutions and learning about new technology, I find myself most excited when I combine the two fields to solve user needs and create great products.
    I have created two products as well as founded my own buisness which you can read more about on the home page. 
    These experiences have solidified my love for creating products and that is why I am so passionate about product management! 
    I find my experiences working as a product manager have allowed me to combine my buisness knowledge and strategy with my technical capabilities to create products that solve problems for people.
